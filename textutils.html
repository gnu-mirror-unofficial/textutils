<H3>Textutils - GNU Text Utilities</H3>

<P>
Fileutils, Shellutils, and Textutils have been combined into the GNU
Coreutils package.  All further development and discussion is now
taking place as Coreutils.  The last separate versions were
fileutils-4.1.11, textutils-2.1, and sh-utils-2.0.15.  The first major
release of coreutils-5.0 was announced on Fri, 4 April 2003.
</P>

<P>
Please refer to the new coreutils home page at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">
http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/</a>
for more information.
