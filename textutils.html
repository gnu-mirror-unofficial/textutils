<h2>Textutils - GNU Text Utilities</h2>

<p>
Fileutils, Shellutils, and Textutils have been combined into the GNU
Coreutils package.  All further development and discussion is now
taking place as Coreutils.  The last separate versions were
fileutils-4.1.11, textutils-2.1, and sh-utils-2.0.15.  The first major
release of coreutils-5.0 was announced on Fri, 4 April 2003.

Please refer to the new coreutils home page at
<a href="/software/coreutils/">
http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/</a>
for more information.

     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the

     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
